Generates a users top tracks for each month

## Current State

Currently, we scrape a user's Last.fm profile, grabbing top monthly tracks and
dropping them in a Spotify playlist using the Spotipy library. However, due to the
ubiquity of Spotify and lack of ubiquity on the part of Last.fm, the project will
ultimately include a tracker. This application will ultimately be web-based.
